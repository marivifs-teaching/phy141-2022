Heat is not a state variable, it depends on the path taken to get the system to it&#039;s state. Entropy, on the other hand, is a state variable, the change in entropy required to change a system from one state to another via a reversible process is independent of the path taken.\n",

The definition of a reversible cycle is that the system is always infinitesimally close to being in thermal equilibrium with it's environment, in which case we can see that the change of entropy in the environment is also zero. If this is not the case then a heat engine will instead increase the entropy of its environment which each cycle, and as the system itself does not have a changes in entropy this leads to a net increase in the entropy of the universe whenever work is done by any real engine cycle.  \n",
