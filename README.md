## Course Description

**PHY141/142 Honors Classical Physics** is the honors section of a fast-paced, two-semester long, survey of classical physics, primarily for students
majoring in Physics, Mathematics, or Engineering. Topics for the first semester include classical mechanics, oscillations and (sound) waves, fluids, and
thermodynamics. The second semester discusses electricity, DC and AC currents, magnetism and electromagnetic waves, light, optics, and a few topics in
modern physics.

The course has three 55-minute lectures per week with quizzes and assigned homework. Homework (online) will be graded and counts towards the final grade.

## Lectures and Recitations

The course will be **in person** only. While there might be one or two instancs when the lectures might be delivered via zoon (mot possible this will not happen, but is an open option if I have to attend an in person conference elsewhere), all the students should assume that the lectures will be in person.

* Lectures: MoWeFr 9:15 AM - 10:10 AM room P123, Physics building
* Recitation: Fr 10:30 AM  - 11:25 AM room P123, Physics building
